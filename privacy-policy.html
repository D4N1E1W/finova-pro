            <p class="text-lg">The Max Maher Show LLC d/b/a FINOVA ("FINOVA", "We", "Our") values and respects your privacy. This Privacy Policy ("Policy") demonstrates our commitment to collecting, using, maintaining, protecting, and disclosing your information fairly and responsibly. Any capitalized terms not defined herein shall have the definition provided in the Site's Terms of Service. This Policy applies to your use of this Site.</p>

            <h2 class="text-white text-2xl font-bold mt-8 mb-4">The Information FINOVA Collects</h2>

            <h3 class="text-white text-xl font-bold mt-6 mb-2">1.1 When You Browse the Site</h3>
            <p>Like most websites, the Site collects certain information automatically and stores it in log files. This information is technical and usage information and may include information about how you use our website and Services (e.g., the pages you view, the links you click, etc.), information about your browser and online usage patterns (e.g., Internet Protocol address, browser type, browser language, referring / exit pages and URLs, pages viewed, whether you opened an email, links clicked, etc.), and information about the device(s) you use to access the website and Services (e.g., mobile device identifier, mobile carrier, device type, model and manufacturer, mobile device operating system brand and model, and whether you access the website and Services from multiple devices).</p>
            <p>FINOVA collects technical and usage information to fulfil our legitimate interest in understanding how website visitors use the website, and to assist us in more effectively administering the Site and providing the Services. FINOVA uses certain cookies, and more information on these cookies and our use of them can be found on the Privacy Policy.</p>
            <p>FINOVA may use aggregated data about our Site users and disclose the results of such aggregated (but not personally identifiable) information to our partners, service providers, advertisers, and/or other third parties for our business purposes.</p>

            <h3 class="text-white text-xl font-bold mt-6 mb-2">1.2 Information You Submit to FINOVA Through the Site</h3>
            <p>The Site has several features through which you are able to enter personal information. When you fill out a form or provide information through the Site, FINOVA will use that information for the purpose for which it was collected and for other reasonably related purposes FINOVA determines are appropriate. FINOVA may provide your information to third parties for the processing of that information solely for FINOVA's benefit, but FINOVA will not provide your information to any third party for marketing purposes except in connection with information requests you make that involve third parties or in connection with events that involve presentations or sponsorship by third parties.</p>
            <p>FINOVA's Site also provides links by which users may e-mail FINOVA or one of its Coaches. If you correspond with us by e-mail, the postal service, or other form of communication outside of the Site, we may retain such correspondence and the information contained in it and use it to respond to your inquiry; to notify you of FINOVA's presentations, publications, or other services; or to keep a record of your inquiry, request, and the like. We have a legitimate business purpose for maintaining personal information of those who communicate with FINOVA voluntarily.</p>

            <h2 class="text-white text-2xl font-bold mt-8 mb-4">How FINOVA Shares Information with Others</h2>
            <p>The personal information the Site collects from you is stored in one or more databases hosted by third parties in the United States. These third parties do not use or have access to your personal information for any purpose other than cloud storage and retrieval. On occasion, we engage third parties to send communications on our behalf with restrictions on the use of personal information for other purposes. FINOVA does not send your personal information to third parties for their independent use unless: (1) you request or authorize it; (2) it's in connection with FINOVA-affiliated event co-sponsored or co-hosted by others; (3) the information is provided to comply with the law, enforce an agreement we have with you, or to protect our rights, property or safety, or the rights, property or safety of our employees or others; (4) to address emergencies or acts of God; or (5) to address disputes, claims, or to persons demonstrating legal authority to act on your behalf.</p>
            <p>FINOVA's Site contains links to other websites, whose information and privacy practices are likely different from FINOVA's. If you choose to use these links, you will leave our Site, and will then be subject to the privacy and information practices of those websites. We do not control and are not responsible for any of their content or their privacy policies, if any. We do not endorse or make any representations about them, or any information, software or other products or materials found there, or any results that may be obtained from using them. If you choose to access any of the other websites listed on the FINOVA Site, you should understand that you do so at your own risk.</p>
            <p>Relatedly, any personal information you choose to share on FINOVA's social media pages, such as YouTube, Twitter, and LinkedIn, will be visible to persons visiting those internet-based services. Please be aware that the privacy of any personal information you choose to share on those services is governed by the privacy policies of those social media services and not by FINOVA's Policy. FINOVA reserves the right to remove comments or postings from any or all of our social media accounts which we find to be offensive or illegal, unrelated to the intended subject matter or promoting the services or products of other businesses or entities.</p>

            <h2 class="text-white text-2xl font-bold mt-8 mb-4">Where Your Information is Processed</h2>
            <p>FINOVA is based in Puerto Rico. The information we collect through the Site will be processed in the United States. While the Site is accessible to users around the world, the Site does not monitor or profile the behavior of users while in their country of residence.</p>

            <h2 class="text-white text-2xl font-bold mt-8 mb-4">The Security and Storage of Your Information</h2>
            <p>FINOVA uses commercially reasonable efforts to secure your personal information, but we cannot and do not assure that these measures will be sufficient to protect against all efforts to gain unauthorized access to the information.</p>
            <p>Your personal data is stored on the servers of the cloud-based database management services FINOVA engages. Collected data is retained only for so long as needed to fulfill the purpose for which it was provided, or as long as is necessary to for our legitimate business purposes. FINOVA may retain your information for longer periods if required by law, or in relation to legal claims.</p>

            <h2 class="text-white text-2xl font-bold mt-8 mb-4">Children's Privacy</h2>
<p>FINOVA's Site is not intended for children under 18 years of age. No one under age 18 may provide any personal information to or on the Site. FINOVA does not knowingly collect personal information from children under 18. If you are under 18, do not use or provide any information on this Site or on or through any of its features of the Site or provide any information about yourself to us, including your name, address, telephone number, email address. If we learn we have collected or received personal information from a child under 18 without verification of parental consent, we will delete that information. If you believe we might have any information from or about a child under 18, please contact us immediately.</p>

            <h2 class="text-white text-2xl font-bold mt-8 mb-4">Changes</h2>
            <p>We reserve the right to amend the Policy at any time, for any reason, without notice to you, other than the posting of the amended Policy on this Site. If we decide to update our Policy, we will post these changes on this page. Any information collected under our old Policy will be subject to the terms of the new Policy.</p>

            <h2 class="text-white text-2xl font-bold mt-8 mb-4">Notice Information</h2>
            <p>To request access to personal data relating to you which is processed by FINOVA, and/or if you have any queries, claims, etc. on the handling of personal information, please send an e-mail to support@finova.finance.
